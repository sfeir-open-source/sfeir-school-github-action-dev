# Testing Application

[Act](https://github.com/nektos/act) provides some **local testing capabilities** to your GitHub Actions workflows.

- üå¥ You can design some workflows to test your action locally
- üèúÔ∏è Otherwise, you will need to run thoses workflows like any others
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Act** have limitations (some steps need the GitHub Actions ecosystem to run)

# Testing possibilities

You **can unit test** your code depending of your language of choice.
But this will **not test the integration within the GitHub Action system**.

For that you need to see a **Workflow as Integration Tests suite**
or to mock **action/toolkit** function with a JavaScript testing library.
