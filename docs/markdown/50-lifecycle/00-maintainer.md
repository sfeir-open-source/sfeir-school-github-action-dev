# Maintainer lessons

- Project ideas come from everywhere, don't limit yourself and create a public repository even when you may be the only user.
- Don't be perfect from the start, you can improve your project during its lifetime.
- You can choose any name for your project, sometimes a descriptive name, sometimes a play of words,
  - but for the action publish on the Marketplace, prefer a descriptive name.
- Learn to say no as Maintainer or to choose your own way to deal with a situation.
- Don't support all releases of your project all the time, you can depreciate version series.
- Don't be afraid to archived a project if you unmaintained it,
  - May not apply in your entreprise without proper migration guide.
- Don't put yourself under pressure to respond quickly as possible to issues or pull-requests submissions,
  - May not apply in your entreprise if this action is central to a number of projects.

# Inner source Gouvernance

In case of an Action for your enterprise, you also can apply the community guidelines or used the recommandations of your entreprise if any.

Focus point will be to build a repository gouvernance to have a maintainence system in place.

- Do not maintain the repository alone,
- If you are a contractor, do not become the single point of entry of this new project,
- Document the gouvernance so nobody ask for it,
- ... and maintains it of course.
